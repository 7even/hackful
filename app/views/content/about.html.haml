%br/
Born out of the mailing list of a group called Open Coffee London, an
%br/
amazing community of entrepreneurs helping each other everyday.
%br/
%br/
We saw how open HackerNews is and thought we should give our European
%br/
community more chance to flourish.
%br/
%br/
Our next steps include
%ul
  %li
    %strong Local Event Calendars
    = succeed "Both" do
      %br/
    local and major European events, localised based on user settings.
  %li
    %strong Local Angel Directories
    = succeed "Localised" do
      %br/
    based on user settings.
  %li
    %strong More sharing, subscription and data exchange options
    = succeed "Opt-in" do
      %br/
    digest emails, JSON API and more.
